Notes:

###Setting constants

- Constants (in constant.js) are initialized with e.update(), which iterates through each 'textarea' and 'select' and sets that value to the 'id' of the 'textarea' or 'select' from whence it came

  - Constants are set using the the id of the 'textarea' element

- Date is parsed and set to $const.date
